### Welcome!
I currently work with web development technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, NodeJS, ReactJS, MongoDB, and MySQL.  
Repositories are mainly practice projects, larger/more intensive projects are pinned.

## Current Project
Working on Theatre of the Mind, to work on Angular and Typescript skills, as well as to make a project in the full MEAN Stack.
This will be an application designed to help with running table top role playing games, with tools such as
initiative trackers and dice rollers.  See the repo for more information (full README coming soon).

## And More!
Open to collaboration.  
Always learning something!
Open to questions and conversation!
