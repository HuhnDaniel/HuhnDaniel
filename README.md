### Welcome!
I currently work with web development technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, NodeJS, ReactJS, MongoDB, and MySQL.  
Repositories are mainly practice projects, larger/more intensive projects are pinned.

## Current Project
- Cornerstone, a SERN stack website designed to bring together people who create and people who want things created.  
Search by discipline, name, or project to find the right person for your next project whether it be graphic desing, 
architecture, or web development.  See the repo for more information [here](https://github.com/HuhnDaniel/cornerstone).

## And More!
Open to collaboration.  
Always learning something!
Open to questions and conversation!
